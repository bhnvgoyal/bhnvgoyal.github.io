    <h1>Arabic Language</h1>
    <p>Arabic is one of the widely spoken languages in the world with over 300 million speakers. It is spoken in 24 countries and is the official language of all the countries of northern Africa, the Arabian peninsula, and in much of the Middle East, including Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. As the religious language of Islam, it is also the second language of millions of Muslims around the world. Arabic is an official language of the United Nations, the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Conference, and the African Union.<br />
    Taken together, the Arab economies of the Middle East and North Africa contain two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s oil reserves. They also have a long entrepreneurial tradition and many highly-skilled people. These are among the solid reasons why the Arab countries have the potential for strong economic performance. Initiatives to integrate the Arab world into the global economy are opening up numerous potential new business opportunities in the Middle East. The Arab region with its rapidly growing population provides a huge export market for goods and services. The region also has much to offer the world market.</p>
